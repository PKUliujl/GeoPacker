There are two kinds of datasets testing on GeoPacker according to the different thresholds of pair-wise sequence identity. 

pdb30 is directly from [trRosetta](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1914677117);

pdb60 is culled by [PISCES](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/33/suppl_2/W94/2505533).
